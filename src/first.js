                    <p>Before diving into the world of programming let me give you some brief introduction to newcomer programmer. If you are already a intermediate programmer in dart programming language then this might not help you. There are lots and lots of programming language to learn in the current market but there is always one which is better than others in specific field.</p>
                    <p className="example"><b> For instance:</b></p>
                    <ul className="bulletpoint">
                        <li>If you want to make website then you have to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript</li>
                        <li>If you want to make native mobile application then for iOS you have to go with Swift and for android you go with Java.</li>
                        <li>In mobile you can also make hybrid application from other cross-platform languages like JavaScript, Python and Flutter.</li>
                        <li>If you want to go in deep learning like Artifical Intelligence and Neural Network then may be python is best for you.</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p>In the world of programming there is no shortcut. Every high level programmers you see around you have gone throug hard step which you are going now. Programming donot come in a day it requires constant practice and dedication for learning.</p>

                    <p>Most of the time what I hear from others is that if your are not good at mathematics then you cannot be a good programmer which is in my case not true. Yes, I agree it require basic of math but to be a programmer you donot have to memorize all that mathematics formula and theorem to prove certain concept.</p>
                    
                    <h2 className="otherHeading">Prerequisites</h2>
                    <p>This tutorial assume that you are a complete begineer. Donot panic if you don't get a certain concept it will be clarify later in this course as you continue to learn and grow further.If you have worked on JavaScript or any other object oriented language, then it will help you further to grasp the concepts of Dart quickly.</p>

                    <h2 className="otherHeading">Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Dart is programming language made by Google in october 8, 2011. Many programmers donot know this language existed until its modern framework <a className="dart-pad" href="https://flutter.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flutter</a>  came in use. So, dart is a complete object oriented programming language like java and swift. It is also multi-paradigm, functional and support range of programming aids like interfaces, classes, collections, generics, and optional typing. Its syntax matches with C-style and Java.
                    It supports programming concepts like interfaces, classes, unlike other programming languages Dart doesn’t support arrays. Dart collections can be used to replicate data structures such as arrays, generics, and optional typing. Dart is a new programming language meant for the server as well as the browser. Introduced by Google, the Dart SDK ships with its compiler – the Dart VM. The SDK also includes a utility -dart2js, a transpiler that generates JavaScript equivalent of a Dart Script. This tutorial provides a basic level understanding of the Dart programming language.</p>
